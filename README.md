# Image_editor
Image editor built using Python.

Development currently in HALT
Personal notes for later:-
  Brightness and Contrast are updated in the Image_Editor folder.
  Brightness and Contrast are currently implemented using Numpy.
  Next task is to implement Vibrance using Numpy as well.
  Shadow implementation needs to be done in the same LUT as all the other manipulations.
  Crop is implemented correctly
  Rotate needs to be added
  Read exif data from PIL and print it in the box
  Icons are later priority

  Tentative date of resuming: 1 FEB 2024
